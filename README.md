**NEW FEATURES**
- "Start Chase" timer increased to 30 mins 
- All vehicle types supported
- Chase starts by approaching or ramming suspectsâ€”no siren or gunshots required

**Introduction:**
This mod brings back the loved Vigilante missions from GTA:San Andreas (and others). In a similar way, you will have to chase around suspects and 'neutralise' them.
The difficulty climbs as you progress through the levels! As does the pay too, so you can gain some side-cash!
To use this mod, just get in any police vehicle (this includes military vehicles too!) and press 2 to start the missions and follow the onscreen instructions. Press 2 at any time to cancel the current mission. Note that you can't use the police maverick since it will collide with other mods.
You have 3 minutes to start the chase, after that there's no limit. To start the chase, either start shooting the criminals, or approach them with the siren on.

Note: if you have trouble getting the enemies load, try to restart the missions. If that doesn't help, press Insert to reload the mod.

**Installation**
- Make sure you have both the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 and the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package (x64) installed.
